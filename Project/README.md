The final project for the course involved creating a game in the final two weeks of the course. My partner and I decided to do a take on the classic Snake game. Similar to Snake, you control a snake as it moves around the map. It constantly moves forward trying to eat all of the mice that it finds on the way. However, one special twist is that there are mongooses chasing after the snake as it progress through the map. 

The goal is to collect as much food as possible without hitting the lava, your body, or getting eaten by the mongooses.
